[ATON framework](http://osiris.itabc.cnr.it/aton/) - designed, developed and coordinated by B. Fanini (CNR ISPC, ex ITABC) - allows to create scalable, collaborative and *cross-device* 3D Web-Apps (mobile, desktop and immersive VR) targeting Cultural Heritage exploiting modern web standards, without any installation required for final users. ATON offers:
* Responsive, adaptive and scalable presentation of interactive 3D content (mobile, desktop PCs, museum kiosks, immersive VR devices)
* Real-time collaborative multi-user features (*VRoadcast* module)
* Immersive VR (WebXR) for 3-DOF and 6-DOF devices
* Multi-resolution for massive 3D datasets through OGC standards
* Multi-touch interfaces
* Spatial UI (3D labels, buttons, etc...) targeting immersive XR sessions
* Built-in navigation modes, including *orbit*, *first-person*, *device-orientation* and *immersive VR*
* 3D semantic annotations including free-form volumetric shapes
* Fast, real-time 3D queries on visible and semantic graphs and UI nodes
* Built-in front-end ("Hathor") with WYSIWYG rich HTML5 content editor
* Built-in profiler (automatically adapt 3D presentation to different devices)
* Built-in services to access 3D collections and scenes for multiple users via authentication
* Built-in export of 3D scenes/models using different formats (gltf/glb, obj, usd,...) right from the browser
* Event-driven API for fully customizable events (local and synchronous collaborative contexts)
* 360 panoramas and virtual tours
* Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) for advanced materials and custom shaders for complex representations, including latest extensions
* Advanced lighting, including IBL and multiple Light Probes
* Camera/POV transitions, viewpoint handling and custom navigation constraints
* Complex scene-graph manipulation, hierarchical culling, instancing, composition and cascading transformations
* Scalable deployment, from low-cost SBCs (e.g. Raspberry Pi) to large infrastructures
* Multi-temporal (4D) visualization
* Easily extensible through *plug&play* apps architecture and plugins

The framework also provides a *built-in* front-end and services based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for deployment on servers, infrastructures or single-board computers; real-time collaborative multi-user features and support for remote/immersive visual analytics.

## Getting started (quick)
1) Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for your operating system.

2) Install (or update) required modules from main ATON folder by typing:
```
npm install
```

3) Deploy ATON *main service* on local machine simply using:
```
npm start
```

4) Open http://localhost:8080 on your browser.

- [ ] Rewrite Hathor UI elements using new routines from ATON.UI.*
- [ ] Improve main landing page (public gallery), port to ejs and provide more customization
- [ ] New REST API (v2)
- [ ] Rewrite Shu using ejs
- [ ] Improve Shu UI (e.g. new scene, galleries) using new routines from ATON.UI
